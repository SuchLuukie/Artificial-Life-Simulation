# Artificial Life Simulation
 Project that will explore the concept of artificial life and basic evolution in a 2D grid based environment.


# Environment
The environment is a 2D grid where cells interact with one another.


# Organisms
How I envision the organisms working is there are different components that an entire organism is made out of, which will influence the organisms behaviour and food requirements to remain alive.
These components are able to change based on genetics

The gene contains what components it uses and where the components are placed

# Genes
The way the positions are stored in the genes will be as follows
First the letters of the specific components, then the direction of where it's placed
Then in that direction it will be placed like a cone

Example: Cn1
Translation: Consumer north position 1
