# Artificial Life Simulation
 Project that will explore the concept of artificial life and basic evolution in a 2D grid based environment.


# Environment
The environment is a 2D grid where cells interact with one another.


# Organisms
How I envision the organisms working is there are different components that an entire organism is made out of, which will influence the organisms behaviour and food requirements to remain alive.
These components are able to change based on genetics
